Scripts for transferring/archiving data 

See doc/ for full manual 

The basic idea is that the runs / hk / startup files already processed are
stored in a sqlite database, to avoid double counting stuff and allow for
deletion later. 

Because most files are named either after timestamps or event numbers, the file
name is often stored as an integer in the database. This is admittedly crazy. 

To run this, use the nuphase_transfer.sh script which will set all the
environmental variables and run the manager process in the background.
